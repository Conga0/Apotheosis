New player or seasoned veteran? No worries!
Apotheosis is built for skill levels of all types, with brutal endgame content to early game quests you can complete for fun unlocks and optional areas you can visit to fast track your progress to the harder content, if you're a ready for it.

Just be aware Apotheosis is it's own world, so not everything may be the same world you're familiar with.

If you're a seasoned veteran, you may also prefer the seed "hardcore" for a little extra challenge in your journey.

With all that aside, go nuts, have fun and goodluck out there!
