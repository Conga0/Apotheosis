Music Boss rework
Adult Centipede
Fix motd not spawning in downunder spawn area

Make sure jellyfish *scream* for help when alerting their breathren they're in danger
Ensure there's an escape from the jellyfish temple, maybe a bright light you can step into to go back to where the jellyfish who took you there was?
* The portal entity is already made, just needs to be put in world
Review spirit powder
Nerf tuonela Kolmi? (Currently you can only consistently kill him with freeze kick as he is)
Hint towards what the spell book spells are (be creative, maybe use paintings?)
Enchanted book warm-up miniboss to get people familiar with mechanics (Maybe don't reveal hand until library update)

Red Sigil:
After 1 floor of use on a bolt orb build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 71 spirit anger
After 2 floors of use on a bolt orb build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 156 spirit anger

After 1 floor of use on a firebug swarm build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 68 spirit anger

Realism Mode:
All spells do self-damage
Hexes also check if an entity has the associated blood-type to hurt them
Need to find food to eat
All biomes have vanishing fog of war


Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal (Warded rock? Undiggable, kicks the player out when they're inside it, regenerates, disables all digging, EQ & cell conversion spells when inside; The ultimate no-digging solution)
Eldritch Library?

Spell book
Acts similarly in concept the flutes
Spell Book pages are the noita glyphs
NIGHT --> Sets the time to be an eternal night
LIGHT --> Sets the time to be eternally sunshine
DISPELL --> Dispells any ongoing spellbook effects
