Music Boss rework
Adult Centipede
Fix motd not spawning in downunder spawn area
Review how overpowered destruction is in ToSR, if at all
* Potential solutions, if decided to be too powerful (strong to the point of being non-competitive with all other options, highly unlikely considering it's rarity), add a temporary wounded effect upon casting destruction or make corrupt mages immune to destruction
* To reiterate, it'll only really be a problem spell if it's powerful to the point of making other options non-competitive, which I predict to be not the case given it's rarity.
Fix mass materia conversion making shop spells free

Make sure jellyfish *scream* for help when alerting their breathren they're in danger
Ensure there's an escape from the jellyfish temple, maybe a bright light you can step into to go back to where the jellyfish who took you there was?
* The portal entity is already made, just needs to be put in world
Review spirit powder
Nerf tuonela Kolmi? (Currently you can only consistently kill him with freeze kick as he is)
Remove the free jellyfish pearl from the jellyfish temple, replace with lore
Hint towards what the spell book spells are (be creative, maybe use paintings?)
Music Worm Visuals (pain peko) (I've noticed, ironically despite feeling like I want to be told what to do for once, struggle to actually do what others request of me without being shouted at regularly to do so; I feel a sense of disappointment in myself that I haven't finished this task yet and keep telling myself I'll do it tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes)
Fix weird white lines when you eat red sand (This happens due to the new jellyfish bloom shader)
Bug check to make sure planes work properly without incrementing the NG+ counter

Red Sigil:
After 1 floor of use on a bolt orb build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 71 spirit anger
After 2 floors of use on a bolt orb build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 156 spirit anger

After 1 floor of use on a firebug swarm build (~1 cast per second when in combat) I ended on 68 spirit anger

Realism Mode:
All spells do self-damage
Hexes also check if an entity has the associated blood-type to hurt them
Need to find food to eat
All biomes have vanishing fog of war


Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal
Eldritch Library?

Spell book
Acts similarly in concept the flutes
Spell Book pages are the noita glyphs
NIGHT --> Sets the time to be an eternal night
LIGHT --> Sets the time to be eternally sunshine
DISPELL --> Dispells any ongoing spellbook effects
