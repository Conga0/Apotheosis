Music Boss rework
Adult Centipede
Fix motd not spawning in downunder spawn area
Review how overpowered destruction is in ToSR, if at all
* Potential solutions, if decided to be too powerful (strong to the point of being non-competitive with all other options, highly unlikely considering it's rarity), add a temporary wounded effect upon casting destruction or make corrupt mages immune to destruction
* To reiterate, it'll only really be a problem spell if it's powerful to the point of making other options non-competitive, which I predict to be not the case given it's rarity.

Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal
