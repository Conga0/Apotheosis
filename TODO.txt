Fix creature shift icons being transparent
Add Nursing Ant
Make brimstone/ukkostone/etc work passively in the user's inventory
Music Boss rework
Implement graphics for Ethereal Wyrm

Check Orb of Knowledge is working as intended before release.


Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal
Eldritch Library?
