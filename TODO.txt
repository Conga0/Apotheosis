Fix creature shift icons being transparent
Make brimstone/ukkostone/etc work passively in the user's inventory
Music Boss rework
Improve graphics for acquiring orb of knowledge
Improve audiovisual feedback on the reset all progress button if possible, may not be since the gui seems very prone to crashing and not cooperating.
Check Orb of Knowledge is working as intended before release.
Remove debug print from orb pickups before release.
Add an unlock method for the new spells (waterorb is simple and can be unlocked by default, orb of knowledge is complex and should require some level of unlock requirement, wyrm is extremely complex and definitely needs an unlock method/dedicated quest)
Adult Centipede
Update downunder map with lectern & new chest biome

Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal
