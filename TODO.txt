Remove ABBC anti-cheese after it goes to main
Remove artifically adding meat realm to the biome list when the meat biome goes to main
Add warning icon to meat realm if it goes to main without one (God, I'd hope it doesn't come to this)

Check if the crypt ambience would be more fitting for ToSR

Kindly ask spoop to update the toxic worm achievement pillar (They look out of place when placed next to the other 4's updated graphics)

Make the Esoteric Beam explosion sound quieter, abnormally loud in it's current state

Fix Forsaken Eyes not being stainable
Fix healing being infinite with wand refresh in hardcore
Fix creatures from eggs not retaining their charm when creature shifted (ie mudmen from muddy eggs)
Fix tentacler portal hitting itself (so it doesn't need melee immunity)
Fix shifted hamis behaving weirdly when spawning from nests/purple vases







Ideas:
Giant Mages in challenge zone
Books which grant temporary buffs, healing, berserk, poem of serville, etc
Portal stabilization area in center
"You did it!" trophy for "winning" the biome
Surrounded by cursed rock, can only enter via a portal
