# Install Instructions

 - Download the *[latest release](https://github.com/Conga0/Apotheosis/releases/latest)*
 - Extract into your noita mod folder (`C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Noita/mods/` for steam users)
 - Rename `Apotheosis-main` to `Apotheosis` (If it is already called `Apotheosis` you can ignore this step)
 - To check the filepath is correct, the filepath to the file called init.lua should look like this: `Noita/mods/Apotheosis/init.lua`

 - Avoid downloading source code as it contains work in progress scripts and entities that will likely not be entirely functional and subject to drastic change.
