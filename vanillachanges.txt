This is a list of all changes this mod introduces which may affect vanilla content in some way.
If you're confused why something feels different, this list may help you identify what's new.

** Omega disc, plasma &  music note spells only hit every 15 frames instead of every 1 frame
** Some spells have had their mana cost drastically reduced to become competitive with other spells again, which includes but is not limited to: Death Cross, Chaotic Transmutation, Intense Concentrated Light, Tier 2&3 spitterbolts, and various other spells
** Bubbly Bounce no longer does self damage
** Arrow no longer has increased recoil
** Chainsaw now costs 12 mana
** Giant Explosion on Drunk Enemies now has unlimited charges
** Giant Explosion on Slimy Enemies now has unlimited charges
** Spells to Power can only spawn in Heaven, Hell & other high-tier spell locations, the goal behind this is StP is a very endgame spell capable of insanely high Damage output, if you want endgame damage spells, you need to visit endgame biomes
** Piercing Shot is reworked, it now costs less mana, no longer reduces projectile damage but hits 5 times per modifier, becoming infinite at 50 pierces
** Path of Dark Flame can appear in lower tier spell pools
* Projectile Repulsion Field is removed and replaced with Oversized Shield
* Faster Movement is removed, Faster Levitation is removed, Haste replaces both of these perks and combines them into one, providing a 40% movement speed boost in all directions per stack
* Contact Damage now grants melee immunity
* Sauvojen Tuntija now summons blackhole wands if it can't make line of sight with you for too long
* Relocated Friend Cave 1 & 2

* Giga Death Cross now uses green wand particles instead of blue
* Low Recoil is replaced with No Recoil
* Pit Boss now has a projectile failsafe incase it spawns too many wands (over 1k with high boss health multipliers)
* Individual Enemies can now drop a maximum of 250k gold at any given time to prevent crashes in high NG+ runs (high NG+ runs usually become unplayable at a certain point otherwise if enemies start dying, flooding the screen with hundreds, sometimes thousands of gigantic physics objects)
* Summon Egg spell features new eggs it can roll
* Unstable Crystal can now be affected by Larpa
* Playerghosts can now "parry" tablets
* Friendship quest now is now slightly more involved
* Toxic Immunity now grants immunity to toxic damage
* Masters of Homing are now made of a slightly tastier meat than slime
* You can now eat from pouches in the inventory
** Chaotic Transmutation now costs 40 mana (down from 80, goal is to become more practical in lua-disabling wands)
