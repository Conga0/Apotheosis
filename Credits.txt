Bonus shoutouts to:
Freakstritch - I don't think you'll ever read this but.. thankyou for making More Creeps & Weirdos all those years ago. I loved it. That mod means so much to me and impacted me in ways I don't think I could properly express in a simple word document I think you'll never read.. If I ever get in contact with you man, or you read this document long after I'm gone.. just.. Thankyou. Thankyou so much for making what you did.
Hinoguchi Sorako - As far as i'll say in publicly available credits notes.. Beyond just voice acting the cats, you've been cool as hell and really nice to spend time with, thankyou.
Moriko Yumi - As far as i'll say in publicly available credits notes.. You mean a lot, although i've also done one (now deleted) developer playthrough of Apotheosis on a livestream, it was entirely because of you. You're also cool as hell and i'm geninely really happy I met you, thankyou.
Voksivs - First play tester of More Creeps in the public eye, you've been a blast to watch and I genuinely enjoy hanging out in your streams, they're higher energy than a power plant- I hope everything works out for you man
Tanksy Plays - Another beta tester of More Creeps in the public eye, I enjoyed watching your streams and got some good feedback & bug testing from them; also you've been a cool guy to hang out with in General outside of streaming & noita, thanks man
clemfandongo - Yet another beta tester in the public eye for More Creeps, thankyou man, I haven't seen you stream in ages as of writing but hopefully you can pop up again sometime, I hope you're doing well
Aliasbot - You absolutely destroyed so many bosses, progressed more in the mod in a single day than everyone else has since it came out, you were so busted even I had to buff some enemies specifically because of you (and remove some polymorph crystals from certain areas)
DunkOrSlam's Community - Thankyou for voting overwhelmingly for MoreCreeps in the first ever DunkOrSlam modded day! It makes me feel really happy seeing you guys enjoy it so much to the point you wanted to see your favourite streamer play it, in addition to so many of you too! For that, thankyou, it made me feel like all the hard work was worth it that little bit more
FuryForged - You've never played my mod as of writing (as far as I know), but your modded noita lets play videos on youtube pushed me a lot to create apotheosis, I especially enjoyed watching it while modding. For that and all the other awesome noita content, thankyou man.
Albino - Honestly, I'l exhausted as hell writing this, but it's been a ton of fun watching your playthrough man, from you making it a blast to watch, to chat memeing on things every 5 minutes to you making the phonecall that breaks your femur, it's been a blast mate. Congratulations on getting the first documented ascension of Apotheosis
42oblaze_it - It's been fun as hell watching your stream and it's been invaluable feedback, thanks for the chill vibes man!


And the various modders of the Noita discord, you've helped me through hell and back, thankyou.

I'm sure I've missed a few, there's definitely people I wanted to thank but couldn't find their name in memory unfortunately.
Thankyou to you too
